### Live Streaming

---

Operating the live streaming feature of TiwiFlix involves several steps to ensure a seamless and engaging experience for both content creators and viewers:


 **Connect Wallet as a Creator:**

- The first step for a content creator is to connect their cryptocurrency wallet to the TiwiFlix Dapp. This wallet connection enables transactions and ensures that the creator receives payments or tips during the live stream.
- The creator logs into their account on the platform and accesses the live streaming feature.

 **Start a Live Stream:**

- Once the wallet is successfully connected, the creator can choose to start a live stream instantly or schedule it for a future time.

- If starting instantly, the creator selects the "Start Live Stream" option from the dashboard or live streaming interface.

- If scheduling for a future time, the creator specifies the date and time for the live stream to commence. This feature allows for better planning and promotion of the live event.

 **Set Duration of Stream (if Applicable):**

- The creator has the option to set the duration of the live stream if they want to limit the broadcasting time.

- They specify the duration either before starting the live stream or during the setup process.

- Once the set duration elapses, the live stream automatically ends, providing a structured viewing experience for the audience.

 **Set the Maximum Number of Users That Can Join the Stream (if Applicable):**

- In some cases, the creator may want to limit the number of users who can join the live stream concurrently. This feature helps maintain the quality of interaction and prevents overcrowding.


- The creator specifies the maximum number of users allowed to join the stream before initiating the live session.


- Once the maximum capacity is reached, additional viewers are prevented from joining until existing viewers leave the stream.

 **Share the Live Link:**

- After setting up the live stream parameters, the creator receives a unique live streaming link generated by the TiwiFlix Dapp.


- The creator can share this link across various platforms such as social media, email newsletters, or directly with their audience.


- Viewers can access the live stream by clicking on the shared link, which redirects them to the TiwiFlix live streaming page.


By following these operational steps, content creators can leverage the TiwiFlix live streaming feature to engage with their audience in real-time, foster community interaction, and monetize their content effectively.
