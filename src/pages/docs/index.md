### Overview of the TIWIFLIX

---

Our TiwiFlix is a revolutionary platform that embraces decentralization, offering video creators and viewers a secure and transparent environment for sharing and consuming video content. The platform leverages blockchain technology and smart contracts to redefine content ownership, monetization models, and community collaboration.

### Working Modes

---
TiwiFlix has two working modes: the General Mode and the Creator Mode

The TiwiFlix General Mode is developed to contain video content that is free or readily available on the internet. With TiwiFlix General Mode, the users' need for an organized and ad-free video-sharing platform is met. No Ads, no private data breaches, and no hassle of making extensive internet searches. In TiwiFlix General Mode, the TIWI Content Access Token, TIWICAT, is NOT spent or moved from the user's wallet. Users only need to hold at least 1 USDT worth of it for access.

The TiwiFlix Creator Mode empowers content creators, movie producers and companies with essential tools to produce and promote their content. Creators will be able to manage their payment structures and gateways.

### Key Features and Benefits

---

- **Decentralized Content Ownership:** Blockchain and smart contracts ensure transparent and immutable records of content ownership.
- **Professional Video Management Tools and Live Streaming:** TiwiFlix Creator Mode makes Hi-Tech video management and livestream tools available to everyone. Creators can broadcast themselves and do it in a decentralized manner with full autonomy.
- **Multiple Blockchain Networks Compatibility::** TiwiFlix is multi-chain. This means creators can settle their payment with TIWICAT or any coin or token under any blockchain network. TiwiFlix Creator Mode supports both EVMs and other blockchain networks. This also means any crypto project can set up a creator account and integrate their tokens as the payment method.

- **Gasless Transaction Options:** To avoid the gas fee payment on every transaction, there is a feature on the TiwiFlix Creator Mode to create the digital twins of TIWICAT. Users can convert their TWC to Digital-TIWICAT (DTWC) and can access the contents of creators who have set up DTWC as a payment option without having to pay further gas fees.

- **Flexible Monetization Options:** Creators can choose from pay-per-view or revenue-sharing models to monetize their content.
