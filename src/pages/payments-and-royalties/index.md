### Monetization Options

---

Creators can maximize their revenue by exploring the diverse monetization options available on the platform. Since TiwiFlix is multi-chain, creators can settle their payment with TIWICAT or any coin or token on any blockchain network.


### Payment Process

---

The payment process on TiwiFlix is facilitated by smart contracts requiring gas fees to execute. However, a gasless payment feature is possible on TiwiFlix when the digitalized TIWICAT (DTWC) is used as a payment option by a creator. TiwiFlix is integrated with a converter that enables the creation of a TIWICAT digital twin. A one-time gas fee payment is needed for the conversion of TIWICAT (TWC) to the Digitalized TIWICAT (DTWC), however, no gas fee payment is further needed for completion of transactions with DTWC on the platform.

### Royalty Calculation

---

100 per cent of the revenue generated on the platform goes to the creators when DTWC, which facilitates gasless transactions, is used by the creators as a payment settlement method. However, there is revenue sharing when a creator chooses other tokens or coins as payment options. In the latter case, 90 percent of the revenue generated goes to the creator while 10 percent is charged to service the platformâ€™s operational costs.
